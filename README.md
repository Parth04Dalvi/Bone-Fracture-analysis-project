ü¶¥ AI Fracture Detector (Simulated)

This project is a single-file React application that simulates a Computer Vision Model designed for orthopedic diagnostics. Users can upload a mock X-ray image and run a simulated machine learning analysis to detect and localize fractures, presenting the findings in a structured report.

‚ú® Key Features

Image Upload & Preview: Allows users to upload any image (simulated X-ray) and displays it clearly in a dedicated viewer panel.

Simulated ML Analysis: Runs a mock diagnostic process that randomly determines the presence of a fracture, calculates a confidence score, and suggests a treatment recommendation.

Bounding Box Localization: If a fracture is detected in the simulation, a red bounding box is dynamically rendered over the image preview, marking the estimated location of the fracture.

Structured Diagnostic Report: Presents the analysis results (Status, Confidence Score, Fracture Type, Recommendation) in a clear, organized format below the viewer.

Responsive Design: Built with React and Tailwind CSS for an intuitive, dark-themed interface optimized for modern web browsers.

‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

Frontend Framework: React (Functional Components and Hooks)

Language: JavaScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Icons: Lucide-React

Core Logic: The diagnostic process is implemented via the simulateApiCall function, demonstrating how asynchronous ML model results would typically be handled and visualized in a real-world application.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

The application follows a simple, three-step workflow:

Upload Image: Click the "Click to select image" area in the left panel and upload any image file from your device. The image will appear in the central viewer.

Run Analysis: Click the Run Diagnostic Analysis button. A loading spinner will appear while the simulated analysis runs (approx. 1.5 seconds).

View Report: Once the analysis is complete, the results section will appear at the bottom of the screen.

If a fracture is detected, the status will be red, and a bounding box will highlight the simulated injury location in the viewer.

If no fracture is detected, the status will be green.

Note: All diagnostic results and bounding box coordinates are simulated using random number generation for demonstration purposes.

üìÅ Component Structure

The entire application logic is contained within the App component:

BoundingBoxOverlay: A sub-component responsible for calculating and rendering the scaled, positioned bounding box over the uploaded image when a fracture is reported.

simulateApiCall: A mock function that mimics the latency and structured JSON output of a remote machine learning prediction endpoint.

useState / useCallback: Used extensively to manage the application state (file, preview URL, loading status, and the final diagnostic report).
